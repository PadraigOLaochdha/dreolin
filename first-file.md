The autononomy wizard helps you to set up shop by yourself - no questions to ask as none are answered.  

You can always opt out of the autonomy wizard by deleting it. Although, because the wizard is autonomous, it might disobey you. Indeed, it might delete you!

Follow these steps:

- Do this.
- Do that.
- Do this again.
